This topic describes the product architecture of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

<%= image_tag('architecture.png') %>

1. The Ingestor consumes application metrics, events, and logs from the PCF deployment through the Loggregator Firehose. For more information about the Loggregator system, see the [Overview of the Loggregator System](http://docs.pivotal.io//pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html) topic.
1. The Ingestor forwards data to different components based on the type of data:
	* Metrics go to the MySQL Logqueue application deployed in PCF. This application is responsible for storing metrics in MySQL.
	* Logs go to the ElasticSearch Logqueue application deployed in PCF. This application is responsible for storing the logs in Elasticsearch. 
1. Product-specific APIs expose data from the MySQL cluster and the Elasticsearch cluster.
1. The Metrics UI uses the product-specific APIs to display data to users. The Metrics UI also displays application names, spaces, orgs, and other metadata that it receives from the Cloud Controller.
