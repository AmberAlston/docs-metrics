This document describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: With the addition of application logs in PCF Metrics 1.1.X, the product has introduced new Elastic Search Master and Data nodes for logs storage. The additional storage required to support application logs increases the default tile size on install to approximately 250GB.</p> 

## <a id='pre-reqs'></a>Prerequisites

Ensure that you have installed the [Elastic Runtime Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The default <strong>Loggregator Port</strong> in Elastic Runtime is 443. In an AWS environment, the port must be changed to 4443.</p> 
  
## <a id='step1'></a> Step 1: Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager
   <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: PCF Metrics should be installed on the same network as the Elastic Runtime Tile. </p>

1. Download the PCF Metrics file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to your **Installation Dashboard**.

## <a id='step2'></a>Step 2: Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following procedures offer a standard configuration. To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity, see the <a href="sizing.html">Sizing PCF Metrics For Your System</a> topic.</p>

From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The tile appears orange when it requires configuration.</p>

### Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
1. Click **Save**.

### Ingestor Options

1. Click **Push Ingestor**.
	![Ingestor](push-ingestor.png)
1. Review the **Instance Count** value. The PCF Metrics tile deploys one instance of the ingestor by default. You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound log traffic. 
1. Click **Save**.

### Errands

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Review the **Pre-Delete Errands**. If you deselect the **Cleanup** checkbox, artifacts may remain after the PCF Metrics tile uninstalls.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PCF Metrics tile selects all <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong>, by default. Do not deselect any of these checkboxes.</p>

### Resource Config

1. Click **Resource Config**.
	![Resource Config](resource-config.png)
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job. If you expect a high level of use, you may need to increase the disk resources available to your instances.
1. Click **Save**.

### Stemcell

1. Navigate to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click **Stemcells**.
1. Download the appropriate stemcell version for your IaaS.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> On AWS make sure to use a HVM stemcell if you are using the default instance sizes.</p>
1. Click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded.

## <a id='step3'></a>Step 3: Smoke Testing

PCF Metrics runs a set of smoke tests during installation to confirm system health.

###<a id='smoke-test-steps'></a> Smoke Test Steps

The Metrics tile will perform the following smoke tests:

1. Confirm that metrics are ingested into MySQL
1. Confirm that logs are ingested into Elasticsearch
1. Confirm that the API's return metrics and logs.

###<a id='troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting

If errors occur while the smoke tests run, they will be summarized at the end of the errand log output. Detailed logs can be found where the failure occurs. Some common failures are listed below.
