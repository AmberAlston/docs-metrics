title: Monitoring PCF Metrics
owner: PCF Metrics

This topic explains how to monitor the health of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics service using the logs, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) emitted by Cloud Foundry and the Metrics application itself.

For more information about monitoring PCF, see [Monitoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/index.html).

## <a id="healthwatch"></a>Healthwatch

The premier way to monitor PCF Metrics is using [Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/installing.html).
Once installed, navigate to the JobHealth dashboard to view the PCF Metrics deployment which is named `apmPostgres`.

Healthwatch also supports [alerting](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/api/alerts.html) based on VM persistent
disk percentage `system.disk.persistent.percent` and VM health `system.healthy`.

## <a id="syslog"></a>Forward PCF Metrics Logs to a Syslog Endpoint

Operators can configure PCF Metrics to forward its process and VM logs to a logging solution via a syslog endpoint.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager 2.4 or later is required to configure PCF Metrics to forward logs to a syslog endpoint. For information about upgrading Ops Manager, see <a href='https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#how-to-upgrade'>PCF Ops Manager 2.4 Release Notes</a>.</p>

To configure PCF Metrics to forward logs to a syslog endpoint, do the following:

1. In the PCF Metrics tile, click **Settings**, then click **Syslog**. 
   <%= image_tag("syslog2.png", :alt => "Syslog Settings") %>

1. For **Do you want to configure Syslog forwarding?**, select **Yes**.
   <%= image_tag("syslog3.png", :alt => "Enable Syslog Form") %>

1. For **Address** and **Port**, enter the address and port of the syslog server. For **Transportation Protocol**, select the desired transportation protocol. 
   <%= image_tag("syslog4.png", :alt => "Syslog Config") %>

1. Optionally, select the **Enable TLS** checkbox to enable TLS. If you enable TLS, enter the **Permitted Peer** and **SSL Certificate**. 
   <%= image_tag("syslog5.png", :alt => "Syslog TLS Settings") %>

1. For **Queue Size**, enter the number of log messages the syslog server buffer holds before dropping messages. By default, the queue size is 100000. 
   <p class='note'><b>Note</b>: Pivotal recommends a queue size of 100000 or less. A queue size larger than 100000 may cause performance issues.</p>
   <%= image_tag("syslog6.png", :alt => "Syslog Queue Settings") %>

1. Click **Save**. 

1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** and run the PCF Metrics errands to apply your changes. 

## <a id="kpi"></a>Key Performance Indicators

KPIs for PCF Metrics are the metrics that operators find most useful for monitoring their PCF Metrics service. KPIs are high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging issues.

Pivotal provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance for typical PCF Metrics installations.
Pivotal recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their installation by observing historical trends.
Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, installation-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their own installations.

### <a id="bosh-metrics"></a> BOSH Metrics

All BOSH-deployed components generate the following metrics. Monitor them to ensure that they are not consuming excess resources.

<table>

   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>Percentage used of the VM Memory for MySQL, Redis, and PostgreSQL.<br><br>
      <strong>Use</strong>: Too much VM Memory usage will likely negatively impact data storage and access performance.

### <a id="component-metrics"></a> Component Metrics

All applications pushed using Cloud Foundry automatically emit the following application component metrics.
PCF Metrics is a collection of applications like any other CF applications, and thus can be monitored by PCF Metrics (among other monitoring services).
The following KPIs can indicate problems with your installation.

<table>
   <tr><th colspan="3" style="text-align: center;"><br> system.mem.percent<br><br></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>Percentage used of the application container memory for PCF Metrics applications.<br><br>
      <strong>Use</strong>: PCF Metrics applications running out of memory will likely negatively impact performance.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Origin</strong>: rep<br>

### <a id="custom-metrics"></a> Custom Metrics

Installing the [Metrics Forwarder tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/metrics-forwarder/installing.html) will allow one to
gather more fine-grained metrics from the PCF Metrics deployment.

All PCF Metrics applications are already set up to emit certain custom metrics to indicate application health.
As long as the Metrics Forwarder is installed, custom metrics are viewable in PCF Metrics.
The following KPIs can indicate problems with your installation.

<table>
   <tr><th colspan="3" style="text-align: center;"><br> metric-processor.envelopes-stored.rate.1-minute<br><br></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>The rate at which metrics processor stores metric envelopes to its persistent data store for metrics-queue.<br><br>
      <strong>Use</strong>: Zero-value rate indicates that no metrics have been stored, which is likely caused by some major metrics processing errors or failures.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Origin</strong>: metrics-forwarder<br>
      <strong>Type</strong>: gauge<br>
      <strong>Frequency</strong>: Every minute<br>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended measurement</th>
      <td>Every minute for the past 30 minutes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended alert thresholds</th>
      <td>A 0 value at any point in the past 30 minutes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended response</th>
