**Release Date: TBD, 2016**

### Notes

The following sections describe what's new in PCF Metrics 1.2.0. 

#### New Requirements and Configurations

PCF Metrics 1.2.0 requires the Redis tile version 1.6 or later. 

Consider the following updates when configuring and deploying PCF Metrics 1.2.0. You can find more information in the [Installing PCF Metrics](./installing.html) topic.

* **Alerts**: You can now specify an email address that receives alerts from PCF Metrics about MySQL storage issues. 
* **Data Store**: You can now configure additional properties in the **Data Store** pane. 
* **Errands**: The tile includes two new errands, **Remove Legacy PCF Metrics CF Resources** and **Smoke tests for Metrics Data**.
* **Resource Config**: See the [Increased Data Persistence](#persistence) section below to learn about updates affecting this configuration pane. 
* **Stemcell**: This release uses stemcell version XXXX.

#### <a name="persistence"></a> Increased Data Persistence

PCF Metrics 1.2.0 increases the retention period for log, metric, and event data to two weeks. To support this increase, PCF Metrics 1.2.0 includes the following components updates:

* **Log datastore**: The default size of the Elasticsearch cluster is now nine VMs instead of three. 
* **Metrics datastore**: The tile stores metrics data in MySQL instead of IMDS and increases the default number of metrics storage VMs to seven instead of five to support higher capacity and introduce high availability.
* **All VMs**: The default persistent disk usage is 10 times greater than in version 1.1.X.

See the [Sizing PCF Metrics for Your System](./sizing.html) topic for updated guidance.

#### Improved UI

PCF Metrics 1.2.0 improves the user experience by removing the **Dashboard** screen and immediately providing developers with the most useful information in a more robust version of what was previously the **Explore** screen. 

The following list describes how PCF Metrics 1.2.0 further refines its UI. To view the improved UI and better understand the new functionality, see the [Using PCF Metrics](./using.html) topic.

* **Viewing historical data**: You can now view data for the past two weeks. 
* **Monitoring app events**: The new **Events** view displays all start, stop, crash, and update events.
* **Searching Logs**: The **Logs** view now includes a histogram that displays log frequency for the current time frame. The histogram updates based on your search results. You can also download your logs.  
* **Setting the time frame**: PCF Metrics 1.2.0 provides a more intuitive way to focus on the time that interests you.
