### <a id="issues"></a>Known Issues

The following sections describe the known issues in PCF Metrics v1.3.0

#### Compatibility with Elastic Runtime

PCF Metrics v1.3.x requires Elastic Runtime v1.8.9 or later.

#### Data Loss when Upgrading from v1.2 to v1.3

The upgrade process from v1.2 to v1.3 acts in the following sequence:

1. Removes the data storage components of v1.2
1. Deploys v1.3 data storage and ingestion components

The upgrade process does not save any v1.2 data and the new components do not begin ingesting and storing log or metrics data until they successfully deploy.

#### Smoke Test Failure

The PCF Metrics **Smoke Test** errand may fail if your deployment authenticates user sign-ons with an external SAML identity provider or an external LDAP server. In some cases, these external user stores have an additional login procedure that prevents the errand from authenticating with the deployment and validating against the Metrics API.

If you experience this issue, disable the **Smoke Test** errand in the PCF Metrics tile and click **Apply Changes** to run the install again.

See the [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html#er-auth-config) section of the _Configuring Elastic Runtime_ topic for more information on what configurations can lead to this failure.

#### For Operators who Deploy PCF Metrics using BOSH

If both of the following are true, you may experience issues while using PCF Metrics:

* You deploy PCF Metrics using BOSH instead of using the PCF Metrics tile in Ops Manager.
* You use self-signed certificates.

Pivotal recommends using certificates issued by a Certificate Authority for BOSH deployments of this product.
